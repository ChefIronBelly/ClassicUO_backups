[12/01/2021 13:21]  [Guild][Stitchface]: yeah.. cept check this out

[12/01/2021 13:21]  [Guild][Stitchface]: hamstring you dickhead
[12/01/2021 13:21]  [Guild][Pappy McPoyle]: no eval thoguh?
[12/01/2021 13:21]  [Guild][Stitchface]: tracking gives dmg bonus
[12/01/2021 13:22]  [Guild][Stitchface]: it's the same but you get hamstring
[12/01/2021 13:22]  [Guild][Pappy McPoyle]: i would drop parry first
[12/01/2021 13:22]  [Guild][Pappy McPoyle]: eval is a much better damage bonus
[12/01/2021 13:22]  [Guild][Pappy McPoyle]: or so i thought

[12/01/2021 13:23]  [Guild][Stitchface]: if it's about the same i'll drop eval on the posioner too and go tracking

[12/01/2021 13:23]  [Guild][Stitchface]: parry for tracking would be fine too
[12/01/2021 13:23]  [Guild][Pappy McPoyle]: and tracking
[12/01/2021 13:23]  [Guild][Pappy McPoyle]: was awesome
[12/01/2021 13:23]  [Guild][Stitchface]: hamstring be broken
[12/01/2021 13:24]  [Guild][Pappy McPoyle]: the parry is nice for when youmlose your pets
[12/01/2021 13:24]  [Guild][Pappy McPoyle]: you can still fight
[12/01/2021 13:24]  [Guild][Stitchface]: that makes sense.
[12/01/2021 13:24]  [Guild][Pappy McPoyle]: buuuut tracking on a pvp tamer is nice
[12/01/2021 13:24]  [Guild][Stitchface]: hamstring on anything... so good
[12/01/2021 13:24]  [Guild][Pappy McPoyle]: if you wanted you could go up to 90, use flame purgers and astill have room for tracking
[12/01/2021 13:25]  [Guild][Pappy McPoyle]: thats what this guy was before I started raising taming
[12/01/2021 13:25]  [Guild][Pappy McPoyle]: trammie has a video on the template. its the crab tamer one
[12/01/2021 13:25]  [Guild][Stitchface]: what do the purgers bring?
[12/01/2021 13:25]  [Guild][Pappy McPoyle]: but you use purgers instead of crabs
