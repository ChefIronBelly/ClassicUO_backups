[11/05/2021 13:39]  [Guild][Redbush]: i have tier 11 holy and tier 9 void so
[11/05/2021 13:39]  [Guild][Mew Mew]: hmm
[11/05/2021 13:39]  [Guild][Mew Mew]: so your weapon is void?
[11/05/2021 13:39]  [Guild][Mew Mew]: and armor is holy?
[11/05/2021 13:39]  [Guild][Redbush]: no been using holy mostly

[11/05/2021 13:39]  Duluth Trading: *hiking to destination*
[11/05/2021 13:40]  [Guild][Mew Mew]: generally speaking use void on weapon to increase your dmg from proc
[11/05/2021 13:40]  [Guild][Mew Mew]: holy is nice, but for active tanks
[11/05/2021 13:40]  [Guild][Mew Mew]: it does help heal the group, but it's unpredictable
[11/05/2021 13:40]  [Guild][Mew Mew]: since you can't manually trigger it's proc outside phylactery
[11/05/2021 13:40]  [Guild][Mew Mew]: solo tho it might keep you alive to run double holy
[11/05/2021 13:41]  [Guild][Severd]: I'd take void over holy any day and just use chivalry to keep dmg buffs
[11/05/2021 13:41]  [Guild][Mew Mew]: you want to fun either fire/blood or wind/blood as a pure dps
[11/05/2021 13:41]  [Guild][Redbush]: with the high tier ive been procing pretty good and have 2 links to help
[11/05/2021 13:41]  [Guild][Mew Mew]: it's not bad.. i've seen the healing numbers
[11/05/2021 13:41]  [Guild][Mew Mew]: its just not reliable
[11/05/2021 13:41]  [Guild][Redbush]: yup

[11/05/2021 13:42]  System: Faxmachine has completed the achievement: Scribe (Basic).
[11/05/2021 13:42]  [Guild][Mew Mew]: i'd recommend fire armor, blood weapon
[11/05/2021 13:42]  [Guild][Mew Mew]: as a pure archer
[11/05/2021 13:42]  [Guild][Severd]: that'd be cool
[11/05/2021 13:42]  [Guild][Mew Mew]: or.. air / blood
[11/05/2021 13:42]  System: The world will save in 15 seconds.
[11/05/2021 13:42]  [Guild][Mew Mew]: air increases shot speed and you hit cap with chiv spell

[11/05/2021 13:42]  System: World save complete. The entire process took 4.1 seconds.

[11/05/2021 13:42]  [Guild][Severd]: all stats from blood is super disappointing
[11/05/2021 13:42]  [Guild][Mew Mew]: ban that asshole!
[11/05/2021 13:43]  [Guild][Mew Mew]: you don't run blood armor

[11/05/2021 13:43]  [Guild][Mew Mew]: you run the weapon, and stack bleeds from capped weapon speed
[11/05/2021 13:43]  [Guild][Bardo]: no?
[11/05/2021 13:43]  [Guild][Mew Mew]: detect hidden is 100%

[11/05/2021 13:45]  [Guild][Redbush]: i like the void armor for the heals
[11/05/2021 13:45]  [Guild][Mew Mew]: yeah that makes sense solo
