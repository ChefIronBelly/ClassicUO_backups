[07/25/2023 18:51]  [Guild][TobiasFunke]: Somebody said to train up archery with an Xbow, why?
[07/25/2023 18:51]  [Guild][TobiasFunke]: wouldnt that be slower?
[07/25/2023 18:51]  [Guild][Neerul]: slower swing speed means higher skill gain chance
[07/25/2023 18:51]  [Guild][TobiasFunke]: Really?

[07/25/2023 18:52]  [Guild][Neerul]: always best to train with slowest swing speed.  Especially with bow, since you wont use as many bolt
[07/25/2023 18:52]  [Guild][Neerul]: so use heavy xbow
[07/25/2023 18:52]  [Guild][Neerul]: avarhide quiver if you have one
[07/25/2023 18:52]  [Guild][TobiasFunke]: I might have stolen one, lemme see if I can find one
